# Social Proof Section

I created an NFT preview card component, featuring a modern UI design that is responsive across various screen sizes. This project was developed as part of the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U/hub). To ensure responsiveness, I utilized a flex layout combined with media queries. Additionally, I enhanced the loading experience with webkit animations and implemented Lottie animations using JSON files.

## Overview

### The challenge

During this project, I encountered several challenges, including handling different images for desktop and mobile views. To address this challenge, I implemented image selection with media queries. Additionally, I delved into the basics of webkit animations and their functionality, as well as learned how to incorporate JSON file animations using Lottie.
